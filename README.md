## üìö Installation

Here‚Äôs the full installation process for **The Tourist Guide** project:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arifhassansky/roomify.git
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies (Frontend)**

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd client
```

Then, install the required dependencies for the frontend:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies (Backend)**

For the backend, you'll need to set up a separate project folder, assuming you already have the backend code. If not, you may need to clone the backend repository as well.

Once in the backend directory, install dependencies:

```bash
cd server
```

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. **Create a `.env` File (Backend)**

You‚Äôll need to create a `.env` file to store your environment variables such as MongoDB connection string, JWT secret, and Stripe keys. Here‚Äôs an example of what the `.env` file might look like:

```env
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

### 5. **Firebase Authentication Setup**

Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), create a project, and set up Firebase Authentication with the required methods (email/password, Google, etc.). Add your Firebase config to the backend `.env` file.

### 6. **Start the Backend Server**

Start the backend server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start your Express server and connect to MongoDB.

### 7. **Start the Frontend Server**

Now, go to the frontend directory and start the React development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the React development server, and you should be able to view the app by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 8. **Payment Integration (Stripe)**

Ensure you have set up a Stripe account and retrieved your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**. Insert these keys in the backend `.env` file under `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY`.

You can also use test cards provided by Stripe for local development. You can find those details in the [Stripe documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

### 9. **Environment Configuration**

Ensure you have your environment configured for React and Node. You may also need tools like:

- **MongoDB** (for database)
- **Stripe** (for payment system)
- **React Router** (for navigation)

### 10. **Testing the Application**

Once both frontend and backend are running, you can test the application on your local machine. Ensure you check for any issues related to authentication, Stripe payment, and dynamic content.
